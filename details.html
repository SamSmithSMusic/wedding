          <p>To keep things elegant yet relaxed, we ask our guests to dress in business casual attire. Here are some guidelines:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Men</b>: A button-down shirt or collared polo, paired with slacks or nice jeans. Jackets and ties are optional but welcome. Please avoid sweats, shorts, and other athletic wear.</li>
            <li><b>Women</b>: Dresses, skirts, or nice pants with blouses are perfect. Feel free to add a touch of your personal style with accessories, but please avoid anything too casual like sweats, shorts, or flip-flops.</li>
